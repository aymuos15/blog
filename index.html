    <p class="subtitle">Understanding neural networks by reading the implementation</p>

    <p>Neural networks are often taught through mathematics and theory. This is a different approach: understanding machine learning concepts by reading and analyzing actual PyTorch code.</p>

    <p>Each article breaks down a specific concept, showing both the implementation and the reasoning behind it.</p>
