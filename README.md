## Full-Screen Mode on iPhone

This blog is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that can run in full-screen mode on iPhone like a native app.

### How to Enable Full-Screen Mode:

**If you previously added the blog to your home screen, remove it first:**
1. Long-press the old app icon on your home screen
2. Tap "Remove App" → "Delete App"

**Then add it fresh:**
1. Open Safari or Chrome and go to `https://aymuos15.github.io/blog/`
2. Hard refresh the page (pull down to refresh)
3. Tap the Share button (square with arrow pointing up)
4. Tap "Add to Home Screen"
5. You'll see the neural network icon and name "ML PyTorch"
6. Tap "Add"

When you launch it from your home screen, it will open in **full-screen standalone mode** without any browser UI!
